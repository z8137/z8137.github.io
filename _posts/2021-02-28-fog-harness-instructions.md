Thank you for purchasing my products! Hopefully, these instructions help with the install, if any difficulties arise please feel free to contact me for support!

This harness has two sections: one for the interior and one for exterior.   The interior harness will include your relay, power plugs, ground as well as your chosen switch connection.  The exterior harness has a connector <span style="background-color:#c97600">(BROWN)</span> that connects to the interior harness and a ground terminal. The other ends of this harness will go directly into your fog lights.

This harness is designed to have enough length from interior to exterior to be tucked away or shown like OEM at your discretion. When installing the INTERIOR harness, the <span style="background-color:#fff200">YELLOW</span> (20amp fused) wire goes into the <span style="background-color:#00d5ff">BLUE</span> highlighted spot in the fuse box below. For the <span style="background-color:#bfbfbf">WHITE</span> (5amp fused) wire, that plugs into the <span style="background-color:#ff2f0a">RED</span> highlighted spot in the fuse box below.

<span style="background-color:#ff2f0a">NOTE: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FUSE in the No.19 slot, otherwise the harness will not function correctly.</span>
